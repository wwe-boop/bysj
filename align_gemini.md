# Code, Design, and Documentation Alignment Report

This report analyzes the consistency between the source code, design documents (`design/`), and formal documentation (`docs/`).

## Summary of Findings

*   **System Architecture**: The overall system architecture is well-aligned between the documentation and the codebase. The modular design described is clearly reflected in the source code structure.
*   **DRL Algorithm**: The core DRL algorithm (PPO) is consistent. However, there are minor discrepancies in the level of detail for the state space and reward function between the design documents and the implementation. The code's reward function appears more complex.
*   **Experiment Design**: This area has the most significant discrepancy. The design documents describe baseline algorithms for comparison, but these are not implemented in the codebase (`src/baselines` is empty).

Further details are provided below.

## 1. System Architecture

*   **Documentation Summary**: Both `design/system_architecture.md` and `docs/03_system_design.md` describe a modular architecture. The key components are:
    *   **Simulation Core**: Built upon the Hypatia simulator (which uses ns-3), responsible for modeling the satellite network, generating traffic, and managing simulation events.
    *   **DRL Admission Control**: A module that uses deep reinforcement learning to make decisions on admitting or rejecting new traffic flows.
    *   **DSROQ Routing**: A quality-of-service-aware routing module.
    *   **Web Interface**: A front-end and back-end for interacting with the simulation and visualizing results.

*   **Code Implementation**: The codebase strongly reflects this modular design.
    *   The `src` directory is organized into components: `simulation`, `admission`, `dsroq`, `hypatia`, `api`.
    *   `src/simulation/simulation_engine.py` acts as the central orchestrator, initializing and running the simulation components as described in the documentation.
    *   `src/hypatia/hypatia_adapter.py` serves as the clear interface to the underlying Hypatia simulator, handling data format conversion and simulator interaction.
    *   The `web/` directory contains the backend and frontend for the web interface.

*   **Alignment Analysis**:
    *   **Conclusion**: **High alignment**.
    *   **Details**: The implementation of the system architecture is highly consistent with the documentation. The modular structure is well-executed, making the codebase understandable and mapping clearly to the design principles outlined in the documents. No significant discrepancies were found in this area.

## 2. DRL Admission Control Algorithm

*   **Documentation Summary**: `design/algorithm_design.md` and `docs/04_admission_drl.md` specify the use of the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm. They provide a detailed definition of the MDP, including:
    *   **State Space**: A comprehensive state vector including network-wide statistics (e.g., link utilization), QoE metrics, details of the new flow request, and advanced features like positioning quality (CRLB, GDOP) and routing stability predictions.
    *   **Action Space**: A discrete set of 5 actions: `REJECT`, `ACCEPT`, `DEGRADED_ACCEPT`, `DELAYED_ACCEPT`, `PARTIAL_ACCEPT`.
    *   **Reward Function**: A weighted, multi-objective reward function designed to balance QoE, fairness, network efficiency, and positioning quality, while penalizing QoS violations.

*   **Code Implementation**:
    *   `src/admission/drl_admission.py`: Implements the `DRLAdmissionController` which uses the `PPO` model from the `stable-baselines3` library, aligning with the choice of algorithm.
    *   `src/admission/drl_environment.py`: Implements the `HypatiaAdmissionEnv`, a custom Gym environment.
        *   The `_get_observation` method constructs the state vector.
        *   The `_calculate_reward` method implements the reward logic.
        *   The action space is defined as `spaces.Discrete(5)`.

*   **Alignment Analysis**:
    *   **Conclusion**: **Medium alignment**. The core concepts are aligned, but the implementation is a simplified version of the design.
    *   **Details**:
        *   **Algorithm Choice**: **Consistent**. Both documentation and code specify PPO and the code correctly uses a well-known implementation (`stable-baselines3`).
        *   **State Space**: **Partially consistent**. The code implements a subset of the state features described in `design/algorithm_design.md`. For example, global network utilization and basic request features are implemented, but more advanced features like routing stability (`handover_pred_count`, `seam_flag`) are included as placeholders. The implementation is less comprehensive than the design.
        *   **Action Space**: **Consistent**. The 5-part discrete action space is implemented correctly.
        *   **Reward Function**: **Partially consistent**. The code in `_calculate_reward` follows the multi-objective structure from the design document. However, the implementation contains simplifications. For instance, the fairness calculation is noted as a simplification, and the weights for combining the different reward components are hardcoded rather than being configurable as suggested in the design.

## 3. Experiment Design

*   **Documentation Summary**: `design/experiment_design.md` and `docs/06_experiments.md` lay out a comprehensive experimental plan. This includes:
    *   **Scenarios**: Various load conditions (light, medium, heavy, dynamic), satellite constellations (Starlink, Kuiper), and failure scenarios (satellite or ground station failure).
    *   **Baseline Algorithms**: A list of algorithms to compare against the proposed DRL solution. This includes traditional methods (Threshold-based, Load-based) and other DRL algorithms (DQN, A3C).
    *   **Metrics**: A wide range of performance metrics, including QoE, admission rates, network utilization, fairness, and new metrics for positioning quality and routing stability.
    *   **Evaluation Protocol**: A proposal for "Admission-only", "Scheduling-only", and "Joint" evaluation to isolate the contributions of different system components.

*   **Code Implementation**:
    *   `experiments/run_experiments.py`: This is the main script for running experiments. It is designed to load configurations from YAML files, execute the simulation, and save the results to JSON files. It can run a single experiment or a batch of them.
    *   `experiments/scenarios/` and `experiments/configs/`: These directories hold the YAML files for experiment configurations, which aligns with the design.
    *   `src/baselines/`: This directory is intended to house the baseline algorithms.

*   **Alignment Analysis**:
    *   **Conclusion**: **Low alignment**. While the framework for running experiments is in place, the most critical part—the comparative evaluation against baselines—is missing.
    *   **Details**:
        *   **Experiment Scenarios & Metrics**: **Consistent**. The `run_experiments.py` script and the structure of the configuration files are well-aligned with the documented design for running different scenarios and collecting metrics.
        *   **Baseline Algorithms**: **Not implemented**. This is the most significant discrepancy. The design documents extensively discuss the importance of comparing against various baseline methods. However, the `src/baselines/` directory is empty, and there is no code implemented to run any of the specified baselines (Threshold, Load-based, DQN, etc.). The current experiment script can only run the main DRL algorithm, making a comparative analysis impossible.
